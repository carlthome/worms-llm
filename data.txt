'''FSpeech'''/'''Voices'''/'''Speechbanks''' (more formally called '''Accent''') exist in every ''[[Worms (series)|Worms]]'' game. The [[Worm]]s have different voices and can be customized in most games. Players can change their teams' accents in the Manage Teams subsection. During gameplay, the Worm in the team will speak catchphrases before doing anything. You can also hear the speech in the team setup customization.

==Trivia==
*One of Soul Man's lines, "Like a stacks machine!", "Y'all crazy!", "Papa's got a brand new bag!", "I feel good!" are references from [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James Brown James Brown]'s songs. ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papa%27s Got a Brand New Bag Papa's Got a Brand New Bag], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I Got You %28I Feel Good%29 I Got You (I Feel Good)], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get Up %28I Feel Like Being a%29 Sex Machine Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%27ll Go Crazy %28James Brown song%29 I'll Go Crazy])
*The quote "Say hello to my little friend!" from the Wise Guy speechbank is a reference from the movie [http://Scarface Scarface]
*The phrases "Shoryuken" and "Hadouken" are references to Ryu and Ken's special moves of the same name from Street Fighter.
*In ''Worms 2: Armageddon'', the phrase "Fire Punch, made from real dragon scales. For a smokin' punch!" and "Worm-uken Dragon Balls. Fire like an ought to be." are mixed up, so the Fire Punch has the phrase that was meant to go in the place of the Dragon Ball phrase. The Baseball Bat and Prod, however, have no phrases - Kamikaze however, which does have a phrase, is not affected.
*The phrase from the Horror soundbank "I'll tear your soul apart" is a reference to the line "we'll tear your soul apart", said by Pinhead in the ''Hellraiser'' films.
*In Worms HD for the PS3, some speech banks have alternative names;
**Double Oh Seven is named 17.
**Poor Rapper is called Rapper.
**Snitch is named Backstreet.
*Worms saying the word "fatality" is likely a reference to ''Mortal Kombat'' on the finishing moves showing dismemberment, organ-rearranging, gore, etc. known as a Fatality. Possibly portraying Worms falling into the water as a "Stage Fatality". And Get out of my sight or you just might is from ''Mortal Kombat''
*In [[Worms 3D]], the Madchester speech bank is a pun on the Manchester accent, or the manc accent as it's more commonly known.
