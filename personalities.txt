Team Name: The Scandi-Statisticians

Team Description: Equipped with the sharpest analytical minds from the land of the midnight sun, The Scandi-Statisticians are a team of Swedish data gurus ready to crunch more than just numbers. These worms have left their supercomputers and machine-learning models behind to engage in the much more unpredictable world of worm warfare.

Personality Traits: The Scandi-Statisticians are logical, methodical, and unflappable, bringing a cool Nordic precision to their battle tactics. Yet, they aren't all cold numbers and calculations; their dialogue is punctuated by warm Swedish idioms, jokes about coding, data, and artificial intelligence, and an occasional nod to iconic Swedish pop culture references.

Team Name: The Fjord Tycoons

Team Description: Hailing from the oil-rich lands of Norway, the Fjord Tycoons are a powerful bunch of oligarch worms who have traded their boardrooms for battlefields. With their formidable resources and ruthless business acumen, these worms are as adept at launching attacks as they are at launching ventures.

Personality Traits: The Fjord Tycoons are suave, relentless, and competitive. Their dialogue is a unique blend of Norwegian phrases, references to business strategy and wealth, and the kind of swagger you'd expect from high-flying executives.
